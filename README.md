# Home-Search
Have always an up-to date list of homes that meet user-defined the criteria polling casa.it, immobiliare.it and idealista.it
Obviously this code is not suited for a real WebApp since i suppose it will be tailored too much to the sites to be to any use for other individuals except me.


## Objectives
- Have an automated way to look through home listings in one place without too much of an hussle.
- Practice with Dev-Ops tools:
    - Git & GitHub
    - Python
    - Git Actions
    - Jenkins
    - Terraform (?) Maybe?
    - Azure Cloud
- Expolore other intresting tools
